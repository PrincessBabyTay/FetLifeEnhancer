# FetLife Enhancer
Fetlife Enhancer is a User Script and Firefox/Chrome/IE/Safari Extension that adds additional functionality to FetLife.

## Extension
The extension can work on most, if not all, modern browsers.  Firefox is the easiest to install, but still possible on all others.

In the release section, I will have a download for the .xpi file and with all other browsers you can download the .zip file.

Instructions to install are on my FetLife Enhancer group page in the [Getting Started Guide](https://fetlife.com/groups/188715/posts/15159797)


## UserScript
The Userscript can be installed using the [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) extension.  TamperMonkey works on most browsers where as GreaseMonkey only works on FireFox.

Again, any questions can be directed towards my Fetife Group, [FetLife Enhancer](https://fetlife.com/groups/188715/about)
